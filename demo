While William Shakespeareâ€™s reputation is based primarily on his plays, he became famous first as a poet. 
With the partial exception of the Sonnets (1609), quarried since the early 19th century for autobiographical secrets allegedly encoded in them,
the nondramatic writings have traditionally been pushed to the margins of the Shakespeare industry. 
he was granted a coat of arms by the College of Arms, and the family moved into New Place, the grandest house in Stratford.

Pogathae pogathae nee irunthaal nan irupen pogathae nee pirinthal nan irappen
